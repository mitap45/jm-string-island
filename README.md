This is an assignment project for the justmop.com

In this project we calculate and print the number of different
substrings of string s that produce exactly k islands where
s and k are our inputs.

To see the answer for default given parameters run index.php on any web server that supports php.
You can change the inputs in index.php in line 4 to get the result for different parameters.
